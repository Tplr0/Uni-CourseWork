# Python Labs Coursework

**Collection of Python Lab Exercises**
This repository contains lab work and exercises completed during my Python programming coursework. Each lab folder includes scripts exploring foundational programming concepts using Python.

---

## **Features**

* Covers basic to intermediate Python concepts
* Modularized lab folders by week or topic
* Topics include file handling, loops, conditionals, data structures, and functions
* Some labs may include virtual environments or dependency files

---

## **Prerequisites**

To run the scripts in this project, you’ll need:

* Python 3.6 or newer
* `pip` for package installation (if required by specific labs)
---

## **Usage**

* Browse the folders to find weekly or topic-based Python exercises
* Run scripts directly in terminal or an IDE like VSCode or PyCharm
* Modify and experiment to reinforce learning

---

## **Troubleshooting**

* FileNotFoundError: Ensure all required files for a specific script are in the same directory
* ModuleNotFoundError: Use `pip install <module>` to install missing dependencies
* Python not recognized: Ensure Python is correctly installed and added to PATH
