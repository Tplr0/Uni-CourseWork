# APU Printing Services Management System

**IOOP Coursework – C# Windows Forms Application**

This is a C# Windows Forms application developed as part of my Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (IOOP) coursework. The system manages printing job requests at a university-level print services facility. Built using Visual Studio, it includes admin and user management, job tracking, and report generation functionalities.
